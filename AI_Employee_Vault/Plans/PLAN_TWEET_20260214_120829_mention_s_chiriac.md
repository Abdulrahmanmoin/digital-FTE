This appears to be a gratitude/appreciation tweet, likely following some prior interaction (e.g., a like, retweet, or follow). The account name "AI Directories" suggests relevance to the AI space.

## Relevance Assessment
- **Brand relevance:** Moderate. "AI Directories" is tangentially related to AI tools/ecosystem, which aligns with @arahmanmoin1's focus on AI and software engineering.
- **Author worth engaging with?** Yes — someone active in the AI space who has positively acknowledged us.
- **Tone:** Positive, friendly, appreciative. No red flags.
- **Spam/negative?** No.

## Chosen Actions
- **like** — Reciprocate the positive energy; a like is appropriate for a brief thank-you mention.
- **reply** — A short, friendly reply keeps the relationship warm and visible. Given this is a mention (they addressed us), it's natural to respond.

## Reply Reasoning
The tweet is short and friendly. A matching reply should be warm, brief, and genuine. Since the content is vague ("We never stop. Thank you"), the reply should acknowledge the positivity without over-committing to specifics. Keep it under 280 characters, conversational, and human.

## Proposed Reply
"Appreciate the kind words! Keep building 🙌"

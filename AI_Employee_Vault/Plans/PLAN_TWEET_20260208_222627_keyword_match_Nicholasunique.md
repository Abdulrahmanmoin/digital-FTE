# Plan: Tweet Engagement - @Nicholasunique

## Tweet Summary
Author @Nicholasunique (Nick) posted about just starting to learn AI & Automation at @TSAcademyOnline. The tweet mentions trying to locate someone on LinkedIn, with unclear context.

## Relevance Assessment
- **Topic Relevance:** HIGH - AI & Automation aligns with our brand
- **Engagement Value:** MEDIUM - Author is a beginner in the field
- **Context Clarity:** LOW - Tweet appears to be directed at someone specific, unclear reference

## Recommended Actions
**Primary Action:** Like only

**Rationale:**
1. The tweet is relevant to AI/automation, which is our core focus
2. Supporting newcomers to the field aligns with community building
3. However, the tweet lacks clear context ("Lemme locate u sharp on LinkedIn")
4. It may be directed at someone specific rather than general audience
5. A like shows support without inserting ourselves into an unclear conversation

**Reply Decision:** Skip
- The context is too unclear to craft an appropriate reply
- Don't want to misinterpret who the tweet is directed at
- A like is sufficient to show support for their learning journey

## Expected Outcome
- Low-commitment positive signal to someone entering AI/automation space
- Maintains professional boundaries by not replying to unclear context

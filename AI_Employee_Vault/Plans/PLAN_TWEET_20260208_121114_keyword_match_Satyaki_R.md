- Opens discussion about current AI limitations vs capabilities

## Proposed Actions
1. **Like** - Show appreciation for discussing practical AI applications
2. **Reply** - Engage with a balanced perspective on current AI capabilities in research

## Reply Strategy
The tweet makes a strong claim about LLMs replacing literature reviews. Our reply should:
- Acknowledge the real capabilities (AI can help with summarization, initial screening)
- Add nuance about current limitations (critical analysis, novel synthesis, domain expertise)
- Be constructive and conversational, not dismissive
- Position us as someone who thinks critically about AI applications

This creates value by adding depth to the conversation and demonstrates technical understanding of both AI capabilities and research processes.

## Expected Outcome
- Professional engagement with someone discussing AI applications
- Positions @arahmanmoin1 as thoughtful about AI limitations and capabilities
- Opens potential for further conversation about practical AI tooling

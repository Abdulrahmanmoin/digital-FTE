# Plan: TWEET_20260208_222627_keyword_match_MoonRugged

## Tweet Summary
A daily update thread from @MoonRugged (affu - testnet arc) about BASE & ECO ecosystem developments. The tweet mentions:
- A hands-on livestream workshop on building agentic AI with OpenClaw on Base (scheduled for Feb 8)
- Bankr building agent-first infrastructure

Matched our keyword: "agentic AI"

## Relevance Assessment
**Relevant:** Yes - mentions agentic AI and agent-first infrastructure, which aligns with our technical interests.

**Author Assessment:** Appears to be a crypto/web3 community account posting daily ecosystem updates. Not a direct peer or thought leader in our core areas (coding, AI, web dev), but covers adjacent territory.

**Engagement Value:** Low to Medium
- It's informational content, not a conversation
- The workshop mentioned has already happened (Feb 8)
- General update threads rarely benefit from replies

## Recommended Actions
- **Like:** ✓ Show appreciation for sharing agentic AI content
- **Retweet:** ✗ Not highly relevant enough to amplify
- **Reply:** ✗ No natural conversation hook, would feel forced
- **Ignore:** Considered, but like is appropriate here

## Reasoning
This tweet is on-topic but doesn't invite meaningful engagement. A simple like signals we're interested in agentic AI content without forcing unnecessary conversation. It's the right balance for this type of informational update.

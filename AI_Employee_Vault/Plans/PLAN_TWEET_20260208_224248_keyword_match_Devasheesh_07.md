# Plan: Engage with @Devasheesh_07's Tweet on Agentic AI

## Tweet Summary
@Devasheesh_07 posted an insightful thread about the state of AI in 2026, emphasizing that progress isn't about bigger LLMs but about AI doing real work through:
- RAG becoming the default for accuracy
- Agents planning and executing workflows
- Multimodal and domain-specific models
- Governance and edge AI

The tweet links to a comprehensive guide on RAG, LLM, and agentic AI.

## Relevance Assessment
**Highly Relevant** - This directly aligns with @arahmanmoin1's brand:
- Focused on agentic AI systems (exact match for our keyword)
- Discusses practical AI implementation
- Professional, technical content
- Author appears to be creating educational content

## Author Analysis
- @Devasheesh_07 (Devasheesh Vardiya)
- Creating technical content about AI
- Worth building a professional relationship with
- Similar audience and interests

## Proposed Actions
1. **Like** - Show appreciation for quality technical content
2. **Reply** - Engage meaningfully to add value to the conversation

**No retweet** - While relevant, we should engage through conversation first before amplifying

## Reply Strategy
Position ourselves as someone actively building in this space. Reference our work building autonomous digital employees as a practical example of "AI doing real work." Keep it conversational, technical, and authentic.

The reply will:
- Acknowledge the key insight (AI doing real work vs. bigger models)
- Share our practical experience with agentic systems
- Add value without being self-promotional
- Invite continued conversation

## Expected Outcome
Build professional connection with someone in the agentic AI space, demonstrate our expertise, and position @arahmanmoin1 as an active practitioner (not just consumer) of this technology.

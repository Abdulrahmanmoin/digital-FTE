# Engagement Plan: Tweet from @saragenx

## Tweet Summary
Sara (@saragenx) posted about the Agentic AI Market, noting that while it will be huge, there are currently many unanticipated risks. This was detected via keyword match on "agentic AI".

## Relevance Analysis
**HIGHLY RELEVANT** to @arahmanmoin1's brand:
- Direct match to our core interest area: agentic AI systems
- The perspective is balanced and thoughtful (acknowledging both opportunity and risks)
- Author appears to be engaged in the AI space
- This is exactly the kind of conversation we want to participate in

## Engagement Strategy
**Proposed Actions:** like, reply

### Why Like?

### Why NOT Retweet?

## Reply Strategy
Our reply should:
1. Acknowledge the valid concern about risks
2. Show we're actively working in this space
3. Reference concrete experience (building digital employees)

# Plan: LINKEDIN_POST_20260213_231520_dj3bdo

## Post Summary
A LinkedIn post from @dj3bdo providing an educational overview of key network protocols: DNS, TCP/IP, HTTPS, SMTP, WebSocket, DHCP, and UDP. The post is an introductory explainer aimed at developers and IT professionals, wrapping up with an invitation for feedback ("Did we cover the essentials?").

## Relevance Assessment
- **On-brand**: Yes. Networking protocols are foundational to web development and backend engineering. WebSocket in particular is directly relevant to real-time/agentic systems.
- **Author**: @dj3bdo — tech-focused content creator sharing educational material. Worth engaging with professionally.
- **Tone**: Educational, professional, positive. Appropriate for LinkedIn engagement.

## Chosen Actions
- **like** — The post is informative and relevant; showing appreciation is appropriate.
- **comment** — The post ends with an open question ("Did we cover the essentials?"), which is a direct invitation to engage. A comment that adds a missing but relevant protocol (gRPC or QUIC/HTTP3) would add genuine value and position the account as technically knowledgeable.

## Comment Reasoning
The post covers the classic protocol stack well but omits some modern protocols increasingly relevant to developers building AI/web applications:
- **gRPC** — widely used in microservices and AI/ML serving (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, LLM inference APIs)
- **QUIC / HTTP/3** — the next evolution of HTTP, built on UDP, now shipped in all major browsers

Mentioning one of these adds value to the conversation, answers the question honestly, and signals technical depth without being dismissive of the post's content.

# Plan: TWEET_20260208_121114_keyword_match_AfshanKhan73663

## Tweet Summary
@AfshanKhan73663 (Pathan Afshan Khan) shares a takeaway from a GDG Cloud Ahmedabad event about how AI is shifting the developer role from writing syntax to applying engineering judgment. They also mention a hands-on experience building an agentic image editor live.

## Relevance Assessment
- **Topic match:** Strong. Covers agentic AI, software engineering, and the evolving role of developers alongside AI tools — all core to our brand.
- **Sentiment:** Positive and enthusiastic. Professional tone from a tech community participant.
- **Author:** Active in the GDG (Google Developer Groups) community, attending AI-focused events. Worth engaging with.

## Chosen Actions
1. **Like** — Show appreciation for a relevant, well-articulated take on agentic AI and engineering judgment.
2. **Reply** — Add value by affirming the point and sharing our perspective on engineering judgment in the age of AI agents.

## Why Not Retweet
The tweet is relevant but event-specific (GDG Cloud Ahmedabad recap). A like + reply is more appropriate than amplifying a personal event takeaway.

## Reply Reasoning
The reply should:
- Affirm the "engineering judgment" point — it's a great insight
- Add a brief perspective on what that judgment looks like in practice (designing systems, not just writing code)
- Keep it conversational and genuine, not preachy

# Plan: Engage with @johnrushx's Claude Code vs Codex comparison

## Tweet Summary
John Rush (@johnrushx) shared his opinion that while Claude Code gets a lot of hype, he thinks Codex is better for "highly comped projects" (likely meaning highly complex projects).

## Why This Tweet Matters
- **Relevance**: Direct discussion of Claude Code and AI development tools - core to our brand
- **Author**: John Rush appears to be an active developer/tech person with opinions on tooling
- **Conversation Value**: Genuine technical opinion that invites thoughtful discussion
- **Engagement Opportunity**: Chance to share our experience and potentially learn about his use case

## Proposed Actions
1. **Like** - Show we saw and appreciate the perspective
2. **Reply** - Engage constructively with his opinion

## Reply Strategy
- Acknowledge his opinion respectfully
- Show genuine interest in his use case
- Share a balanced perspective without being defensive
- Keep it conversational and professional
- Invite further discussion

The reply should:
- Be authentic and curious, not argumentative
- Ask about his specific use case (what makes Codex better for complex projects in his view)
- Position ourselves as someone interested in learning from different perspectives
- Stay under 280 characters

## Why Not "Retweet"
This is an opinion piece, not something we'd want to amplify broadly without context. A reply is more appropriate for nuanced discussion.

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk: Professional technical discussion
- No controversial topics
- Authentic engagement opportunity

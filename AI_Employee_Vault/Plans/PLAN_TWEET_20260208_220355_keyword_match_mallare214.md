# Plan: TWEET_20260208_220355_keyword_match_mallare214

## Tweet Summary
@mallare214 (bryan base.eth) announced the iOS launch of OptimaiNetwork Edge Node - a decentralized AI infrastructure app that allows users to mine data, power Agentic AI, and earn rewards from their phones. This is a product launch announcement with marketing hashtags (#DePIN, #BUIDL, #Web3, #AI).

## Relevance Analysis
**Pros:**
- Matched on "Agentic AI" keyword - directly relevant to our AI focus
- Related to AI infrastructure and Web3/DePIN space
- Represents intersection of AI and decentralized tech

**Cons:**
- Pure promotional/product launch content
- No technical discussion or insights to engage with
- Not seeking conversation or community input
- Heavy marketing tone with multiple promotional hashtags

## Recommended Actions
**Action: "like" only**

**Reasoning:**
- Shows support for innovation in the AI/Web3 space
- Acknowledges the "Agentic AI" connection without over-committing
- Avoids amplifying promotional content (no retweet)
- No natural conversation hook for a meaningful reply
- A reply here would feel forced or purely promotional

**Why not retweet?**
Our retweeets should be reserved for highly technical content, insightful discussions, or exceptional resources - not product launch announcements.

**Why not reply?**
The tweet isn't asking a question or inviting discussion. A reply like "Congrats!" or "Looks interesting!" would be generic and low-value. We engage where we can add technical insight or meaningful conversation.

## Brand Alignment
This engagement maintains our professional brand:
- Supportive of AI innovation (via like)
- Selective about amplification (no retweet)
- Strategic about conversation (no forced reply)
- Focused on substance over promotion

## Next Steps
If human approves, the orchestrator will execute a "like" action on tweet ID 2020543039979098580.

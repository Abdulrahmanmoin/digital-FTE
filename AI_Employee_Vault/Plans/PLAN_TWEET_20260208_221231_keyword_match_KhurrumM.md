# Plan: Tweet Engagement with @KhurrumM

## Tweet Summary
@KhurrumM is asking @OpenAI for advice on choosing between Codex ($200/mo) and Claude Code. They're leaning toward Claude Code because:
1. Unclear where Codex is better
2. Claude Code has a decent ecosystem
3. Questioning what else comes with the Codex package

This is a genuine technical question asking for community input.

## Recommended Actions
- **like**: Yes - relevant technical discussion
- **reply**: Yes - HIGH VALUE opportunity to engage

## Reasoning

### Why Engage?
1. **Highly Relevant**: This is about Claude Code, which is core to our tech stack and interests
2. **Authentic Request**: Real person asking for technical advice, not spam
3. **Value Addition**: As a software engineer using Claude Code, @arahmanmoin1 can provide genuine perspective
4. **Community Building**: Engaging in tool choice discussions builds credibility in the dev community

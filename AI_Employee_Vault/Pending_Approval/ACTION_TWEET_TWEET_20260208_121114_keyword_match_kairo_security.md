What if your smart contracts could defend themselves?

Agentic attack simulation: AI agents fork your environment and run simulated attacks against your contracts, before real attackers do.

Not a static scan. Not a checklist.

A full adversarial stress test.

That's what

# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: like
Will like this tweet to show appreciation for innovative thinking in agentic AI space.

## Action 2: reply
This is fascinating - agentic red teaming for smart contracts. Are you doing multi-agent simulation where attacker agents evolve tactics based on defense responses? Would love to hear more about the approach.

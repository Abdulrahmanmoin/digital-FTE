In 2026, the fastest way to get clients isn't skill.
It's automation with AI.

If I had to build Editedge from zero again today,
I'd do one thing immediately:
 Automate video creation + editing using AI.

Because clients don't pay for effort.
They pay for speed + consistency.

# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: like
Will like this tweet to show appreciation for relevant AI automation content.

## Action 2: reply
Absolutely. Speed + consistency is exactly why I'm building agentic systems for my own workflows. The shift from 'AI helps me work' to 'AI works autonomously' is game-changing for scaling personal projects. What's your tech stack for video automation?

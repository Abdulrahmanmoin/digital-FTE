# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: like
Will like this tweet.

This shows support for innovation at the intersection of AI and decentralized infrastructure, acknowledging the "Agentic AI" keyword match. However, we're not retweeting (too promotional) or replying (no natural conversation hook). A like is appropriate professional acknowledgment without over-engaging with promotional content.

I used @claudeai Opus 4.6 to build my AI portfolio.

Made it feel like a sci-fi command center, not a resume.

Projects → agentic RAG, research visuals, interactive AI demos.

Does this stand out… or feel over-engineered?

Honest feedback?

Sci-fi command center approach is bold—definitely stands out. Curious about your agentic RAG implementation though. What made you go that route for the portfolio? (I'm exploring similar patterns)

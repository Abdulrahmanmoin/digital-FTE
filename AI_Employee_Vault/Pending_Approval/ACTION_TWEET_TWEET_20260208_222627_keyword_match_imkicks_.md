Generative ai are just gimmick chatbots. There's no real noticeable advantage to using it. There are way better automation tools that don't use LLMs. Nothing that LLMs do can justify its insane cost

# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: like
Will like this tweet to acknowledge the legitimate concern about AI cost.

## Action 2: reply
Fair point on cost. But for tasks like code review assistance or rapid prototyping, I've found LLMs cut my iteration time by 40%+. The value shows up in problems where context matters more than deterministic rules. What automation tools do you prefer?

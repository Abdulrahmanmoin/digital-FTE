Automation existed long before AI.
APIs existed long before "agents".
Rebranding agencies as "AI agents" doesn't create innovation it creates noise.

# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: like
Will like this tweet to show appreciation for the thoughtful critique.

## Action 2: reply
Fair point. The real innovation isn't the label - it's LLMs enabling adaptive reasoning loops. But yeah, slapping "AI agent" on a cron job + API call is pure noise. The gap between automation and autonomy is real.

According to me you can go with GenAI or Agentic AI, which have a great potential and also that is in high demand skills with the MERN stack.

Btw I am also a MERN stack developer learning GenAI.

Great advice! Agentic AI + MERN is a powerful combo. I'm building autonomous agents myself - the overlap between web dev patterns and agent architecture is fascinating. How's your GenAI learning going?

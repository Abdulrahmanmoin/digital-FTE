@OpenAI
 I was trying to decide whether to spend $200/mo on Codex or Claude Code.

I'm bending Claude Code.

My main reasons:
1. I don't know where Codex is really better.
2. There's already a decent ecosystem around Claude Code.
3. What else do I get from the package?

Thoughts?

Been using Claude Code daily for building agentic systems - solid choice. The ecosystem is real (MCP servers, SDK, CLI integrations). Plus you get Sonnet 4.5 included. The autonomous coding flow is 🔥 for complex workflows.

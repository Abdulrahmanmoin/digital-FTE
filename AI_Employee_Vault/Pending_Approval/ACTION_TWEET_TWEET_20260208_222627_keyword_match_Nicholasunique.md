# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: like
Will like this tweet.

**Reasoning:** This tweet is from someone just starting their AI & Automation learning journey at @TSAcademyOnline. While the context is somewhat unclear (appears to reference connecting with someone on LinkedIn), liking the tweet shows support for newcomers entering the AI/automation space, which aligns with our community-building goals. A like is appropriate without inserting ourselves into what may be a directed conversation.

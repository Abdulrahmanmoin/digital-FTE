Action Model AI is pushing AI beyond chat — into real actions.
From executing tasks to automating workflows, Action Models bridge the gap between thinking and doing.
This is what practical, agentic AI looks like.

# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: Like
Will like this tweet to show appreciation for relevant agentic AI content.

## Action 2: Reply
100% agree. Building an agentic system right now that autonomously monitors emails/social, creates action plans, and waits for human approval before executing. The 'thinking → doing' gap is where the real challenge lives. File-based state + explicit planning = transparency.

Dsperse has been on a serious tear lately. Modular ZKML is shaping up nicely, the agentic AI proof work looks solid, and inference has been a major unlock. Props to the team.

The agentic AI proof work sounds interesting! Are they using it for verification of agent decision-making, or more for proving inference results? Been exploring similar patterns in my own agent systems.

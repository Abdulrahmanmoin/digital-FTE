What are folks using as a shared database when working with Claude code / Claude projects / Gemini / Openclaw?

I want to access the same projects across different platforms / agents and finding it a little frustrating for work beyond coding.

Will like this tweet.

## Action 2: reply
For Claude Code, check out CLAUDE.md files for project instructions and the .claude/memory directory for persistent context. I've had success with file-based state management - lets agents share context without heavyweight DB infrastructure.

GitHub Agentic Workflows let you write a plain‑text .md in natural language, compile it, and run a sandboxed AI agent in Actions.
Read‑only by default, write ops need approval.
Game‑changer for repo ops.

# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: like
Will like this tweet to show appreciation for relevant technical content about agentic AI workflows.

## Action 2: reply
This is exactly the pattern we need more of - sandboxed agents with human-in-the-loop approval for write ops. I've been building similar systems locally. The .md → compiled workflow approach is brilliant for auditability 🔥

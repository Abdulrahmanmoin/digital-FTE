Amazon's Q4 2025 retail sales hit $213.4B, up 14% YoY, but stock dipped 8% on heavy AI infra spend. Lesson for 2026: E-com giants are betting big on agentic systems to own the full buyer journey. In Basel, we're building lighter, precision AI that anticipates without the bloat.

# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: Like
Will like this tweet to show appreciation for relevant content about agentic AI systems.

## Action 2: Reply
Totally agree on the lightweight approach. Building agentic systems that actually ship requires focus on coordination patterns over infrastructure bloat. What's your take on balancing autonomy with human oversight in production?

Elon's vision describes a self-sustaining cycle where solar power fuels robot production, chip making, and AI, potentially making money obsolete in favor of energy (wattage) and materials (tonnage).

Possible? Yes, theoretically, with advanced automation and abundant renewables

The bottleneck becomes energy density vs compute needs. Training frontier models requires concentrated power (think datacenter scale), while solar is distributed. Battery tech + grid optimization would be critical. Fascinating thought experiment though!

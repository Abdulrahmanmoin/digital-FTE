I'm writing a skill to analyze a bunch of personal repositories (web-design focussed) and create a custom skill based on personal coding style, tailwind's and generical CSS, etc…

So the model can know my operations and then just needs to get tuned to the projects brand

This is such a cool approach! Teaching the model your personal patterns so it can adapt to different projects while keeping your style consistent. Are you using RAG over your repos or fine-tuning on your codebase?

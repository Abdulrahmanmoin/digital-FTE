Notion Agents 2.0 with Workers and custom script execution looks like a serious step toward giving users real end-to-end AI automation inside their workspace.

# Proposed Actions

## Action 1: like
Will like this tweet to show appreciation for sharing insights on agentic systems and AI automation.

## Action 2: reply
The workflow execution layer is key. Notion bridging the gap between knowledge management and automated actions is a natural evolution. Excited to see how this compares to dedicated agent frameworks.

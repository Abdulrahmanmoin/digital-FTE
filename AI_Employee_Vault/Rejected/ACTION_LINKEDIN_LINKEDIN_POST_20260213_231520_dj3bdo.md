Network Protocols: The Unsung Heroes of Communication

Ever wondered how devices talk to each other across a network? The secret lies in networking protocols, the shared language that makes everything possible—from browsing the web (DNS, TCP/IP, HTTPS) to sending emails (SMTP) and enabling real-time chats (WebSocket).

Here's a quick rundown of some key players: DNS, TCP/IP, HTTPS, SMTP, WebSocket, DHCP, and UDP.

Understanding these protocols gives you a deeper appreciation for the intricate dance of data that powers our digital world.

What do you think? Did we cover the essentials?

Great overview of the classics! One I'd add to the list: **QUIC / HTTP/3** — it runs over UDP (like you mentioned) and is now the default in all major browsers. It solves TCP's head-of-line blocking problem and cuts connection setup time significantly. Increasingly relevant as more infrastructure moves to it. Also worth a mention for backend/microservices folks: **gRPC**, which sits on top of HTTP/2 and is widely used in AI serving and distributed systems. But solid foundation here — these seven are definitely the ones every developer should know cold.

Automation of PhD

Don't know if said yet but most of what is called literature reviews in PhDs can now be done by LLMs. These are usually reviews of academic books/journals.

The exact degree of emphasis can also be handled by AI, including elementary connections and synthesis.

AI can definitely help with initial screening and summarization, but critical analysis and novel synthesis still need human expertise. The best workflow is AI-assisted research, not AI-replaced. What tools are you using for this?

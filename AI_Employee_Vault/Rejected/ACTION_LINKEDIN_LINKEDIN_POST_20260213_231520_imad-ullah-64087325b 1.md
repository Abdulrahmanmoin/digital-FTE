Understanding Motherboard, NIC, HBA, and RJ45 — Components That Power and Connect a Computer System

The motherboard acts as the backbone connecting CPU, RAM, and storage. The NIC (with its unique MAC address) handles network communication. The HBA bridges servers to high-speed storage via Fibre Channel or SAS in enterprise/SAN environments. And RJ45 is the physical connector tying it all together at the cable level.

Great breakdown! Understanding these physical layers pays dividends when you move up the stack too — knowing that a NIC exposes a MAC address helps when debugging Docker networking or writing low-level socket code, and HBA/SAN architecture is essential context if you're designing distributed storage systems or working with Kubernetes persistent volumes. Solid foundation for anyone bridging hardware and software work.

Understanding Motherboard, NIC, HBA, and RJ45

Components That Power and Connect a Computer System
In a computer system, hardware components work together to process data, store information, and enable communication. Among these important components are the Motherboard, NIC, HBA, and RJ45 connector. This article briefly explains what they are, why we use them, and their differences.

1️⃣ Motherboard — The main circuit board connecting CPU, RAM, storage, and expansion cards.

2️⃣ NIC (Network Interface Card) — Enables network communication; provides a unique MAC address. Types: Wired (Ethernet) and Wireless (Wi-Fi).

3️⃣ HBA (Host Bus Adapter) — Connects servers to storage devices in enterprise environments. Used in SANs, supports Fibre Channel and SAS.

4️⃣ RJ45 Connector — Standard Ethernet connector for wired network connectivity.

Solid breakdown! One thing worth adding for devs moving into DevOps/cloud: modern NICs support features like RDMA and TCP offloading that directly impact distributed system performance. And HBAs still matter when you're architecting on-prem storage for data-intensive workloads.

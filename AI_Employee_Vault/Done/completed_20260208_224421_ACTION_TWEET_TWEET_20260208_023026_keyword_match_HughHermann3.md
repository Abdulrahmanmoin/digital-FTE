I have been skeptical of OpenAI, and just realized I'm invested in Anthropic adjacent companies. So here's to Anthropic eating OpenAI, Claude code was just the start. $AMNZ + $GOOGL= $CIFR!

As someone building with Claude Code daily, can confirm. It's a game changer. The agentic coding workflow is something else entirely. Excited to see what Anthropic ships next!

Hello Abdul rehman

Hi Abdullah,

Thank you for reaching out. I noticed your subject mentions FTEs (Full-Time Equivalents), but it looks like the details of your question may not have come through in the email body.

To give you a quick overview: an FTE is a unit of measurement that represents the workload of a full-time employee. For example, one person working 40 hours per week equals 1.0 FTE, while someone working 20 hours per week would be 0.5 FTE. It's commonly used in workforce planning, budgeting, and resource allocation.

Could you let me know what specific aspect of FTEs you'd like to learn more about? For example:
- How FTEs are calculated
- FTE planning for a project or team
- FTE vs. headcount differences
- Something else entirely

Happy to help once I know what you're looking for.

Best regards,
Abdul Rehman

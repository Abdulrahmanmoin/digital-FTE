Understanding Motherboard, NIC, HBA, and RJ45

Components That Power and Connect a Computer System
In a computer system, hardware components work together to process data, store information, and enable communication. Among these important components are the Motherboard, NIC, HBA, and RJ45 connector. This article briefly explains what they are, why we use them, and their differences.

1️⃣ Motherboard — main circuit board, connects CPU/RAM/storage/expansion cards.
2️⃣ NIC (Network Interface Card) — enables LAN/Internet connectivity, provides MAC address.
3️⃣ HBA (Host Bus Adapter) — connects servers to storage (SANs), supports Fibre Channel/SAS.
4️⃣ RJ45 Connector — standard Ethernet connector for wired network cables.

Great breakdown of the fundamentals! One thing worth highlighting for anyone going deeper — HBAs still matter a lot in on-prem environments where you're connecting servers to shared storage over Fibre Channel or SAS. Even in hybrid cloud setups, understanding HBA vs NIC distinctions becomes critical when diagnosing I/O bottlenecks. Solid reference post for anyone building their networking foundations.

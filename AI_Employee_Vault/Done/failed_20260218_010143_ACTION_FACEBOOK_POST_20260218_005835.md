# Proposed Facebook Post

Something clicked for me last week that I wish someone had told me earlier in my career.

I was building an agentic AI system — the kind that runs continuously, monitors inboxes, and takes actions on your behalf. And I kept fighting the urge to make it "smarter" by cramming everything into one big script.

Then I stopped and asked myself: how does a real employee work?

They don't do everything at once. They *sense* (read emails, check messages), they *think* (figure out what to do), and then they *act* (send a reply, update a record). And crucially — they check with their manager before doing anything sensitive.

Once I split my system into those same layers — separate processes for sensing, reasoning, and acting, with a human-approval step in between — everything became simpler. Easier to debug. Easier to trust.

The file system became my "desk." Folders became workflows. A file moving from one folder to another was the system "handing off" work.

It sounds almost too simple. But that structure is what made the whole thing reliable enough to actually run overnight without babysitting.

Sometimes the best AI architecture isn't the most clever one — it's the one that mirrors how a thoughtful human would do the job.

Have you ever found that borrowing a concept from the physical world made a software problem suddenly make sense?

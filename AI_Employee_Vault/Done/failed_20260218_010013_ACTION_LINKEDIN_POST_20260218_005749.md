# Proposed LinkedIn Post

Most developers think building an AI agent means writing clever prompts.

It doesn't. It means building a system.

I've been working on an autonomous "AI Employee" — a set of long-running processes that monitor Gmail, LinkedIn, X, and even an Odoo instance, then reason about what to do and wait for human approval before acting.

Here's what surprised me most along the way:

The hardest part wasn't the AI. It was the plumbing.

File-based communication between components. Crash recovery with back-off logic. Rate limiting to prevent the agent from acting like a bot. Making every decision auditable by writing it to a file before executing it.

The AI reasoning is almost the easy part. The hard part is building something that runs reliably at 3am without supervision — and still does the right thing.

A few things I'd tell my past self:

→ Separate perception, reasoning, and action into distinct processes. Don't collapse them into one script.

→ Files and folders are underrated as an interface. They're human-readable, debuggable, and require no extra infrastructure.

→ Build human approval into the loop from day one. Autonomy without oversight isn't a feature — it's a liability.

→ Treat your agent like a junior employee: capable, but not trusted to act alone on anything sensitive.

Agentic systems aren't magic. They're software engineering with a reasoning step in the middle.

What's the trickiest part of AI agent architecture you've run into? I'd love to hear what others are solving.

Hi Abdul Rahman,



I wanted to send a quick note to thank you for building with MongoDB Atlas in 
2025. Last year, tens of thousands of customers and millions of developers 
depended on MongoDB’s modern data platform for their most mission-critical 
workloads.



We have big plans for 2026, and we want you to help drive them: What should 
MongoDB Atlas prioritize in 2026?



If there’s anything we can build or improve - new features, smoother 
workflows, or small fixes - that would help you work faster and better serve 
your customers, share your feedback below or just reply to this email.

Submit feedback  <https://feedback.mongodb.com/>

 

I also wanted to share three things I believe every MongoDB developer should 
know going into 2026:

 * Diagnosing query performance: The most important skill you can master this 
year is diagnosing and remediating slow queries. Make sure you’re comfortable 
using our diagnostictools 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/analyze-slow-queries/> and workflows 
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/solutions/use-cases/webinar-mastering-mongodb-query-performance-diagnosing-slow-queries>
 for slow queries, andrefining your application’s data model 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/>. 
 * Connecting your AI tools to MongoDB via MCP: Our local MCP server 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mcp-server/get-started/> allows you to manage 
infrastructure configuration and provide cluster and data context to your AI 
coding tools. As models improve and AI tooling standards develop, it’s 
important to provide your AI tools with this context as they write code that 
interacts with MongoDB. 
 * Getting free support on Atlas: Every Atlas organization includes free Basic 
Support via chat Monday through Friday. For deeper technical help, our 
Developer Support tier offers performance optimization and expert advice to 
help you tune your environment. You don’t need to wait for things to break to 
get help. Activate your free30-day trial 
<https://cloud.mongodb.com/go?l=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.mongodb.com%2Fv2%23%2Forg%2F%3Corganization%3E%2Fsupport>
 if you haven’t already, oropen a case 
<https://cloud.mongodb.com/go?l=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.mongodb.com%2Fv2%23%2Forg%2F%3Corganization%3E%2Fsupport>
. 
Our mission remains the same: to help you unleash the power of software and 
data. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!



Thanks for building with us, and here’s to a great 2026.

- Charlie

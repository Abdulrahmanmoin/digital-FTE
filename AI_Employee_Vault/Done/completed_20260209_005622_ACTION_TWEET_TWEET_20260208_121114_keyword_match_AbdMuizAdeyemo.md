Absolutely. Most agentic AI fails because orchestrators try to manage too many subagents.

Middle-management agents and structured handoffs would fix coordination and token use.

The key isn't just model skill-it's how you design the agent org.

Spot on. Designing agent systems like an org, with clear hierarchies, explicit handoffs, and planning before action, changes everything. Flat orchestration doesn't scale, but structured delegation does. Agent org design > model capability.

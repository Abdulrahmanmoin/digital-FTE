## Full Content
Hey, it's Zeno Rocha.

Can you believe January is almost over? We've accelerated into the new year, shipping new features, bug bashing, and doubling down on stability and reliability.

Here are some of the highlights...





EMPOWER YOUR AI AGENTS

https://resend.com/blog/introducing-email-skills

Developers and creators are building increasingly more with AI agents. We released three new skills to give your AI the expertise needed to land in the inbox, add email to your app, and style your email templates.

ANNOUNCING RESEND INSIDERS

OWN YOUR DATA


https://youtu.be/-RzkHd9s8HM?si=O7HpssJrd-xZTnmA

If you're not already storing your own data, we've created and released an open-source project, Webhooks Ingester https://resend.com/docs/webhooks/ingester, which you can set up in a few clicks to store all your own data in your own database using Resend webhooks.

NEW SUPPRESSED STATUS

https://resend.com/changelog/email-suppression-visibility

A suppression happens when Resend intentionally prevents an email from being sent to a recipient. This occurs when deliveries to that address have bounced or been marked as spam. We introduced a new suppressed status to give you clearer visibility into your email performance and help you respond with confidence.

NATURAL WARMUP WINS

https://resend.com/blog/do-you-need-a-warmup-service

Warming up a domain—the process of gradually establishing trust with inbox providers—is important for consistently landing in the inbox. Is it better to warm up your own domain, or should you pay for a warmup service?

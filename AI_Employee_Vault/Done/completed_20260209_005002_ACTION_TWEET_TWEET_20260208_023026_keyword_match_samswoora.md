If software is written in machines they'll just pick zig or rust for everything imo. Feels like you guys just rewrite claude code in a language with a higher perf ceiling

Interesting take! Rust/Zig definitely have the perf ceiling advantage. But I think even AI would weigh ecosystem maturity and dev velocity, raw speed isn't the only bottleneck. The real unlock is AI writing the gnarly low-level code humans avoid.

# Proposed LinkedIn Post

Most developers think building an AI agent is about picking the right LLM.

It's not. It's about designing the right *loop*.

I've been building an autonomous "AI employee" system over the past few weeks — something that monitors emails, social feeds, and business events, then drafts responses for human review before anything is sent.

Here's the insight that changed how I think about agents:

**The intelligence isn't in the model. It's in the folder structure.**

Every action flows through a simple pipeline:
- A watcher detects something (email, tweet, LinkedIn post)
- A planner drafts a response
- A human approves or rejects it
- An executor carries out the approved action

No step skips the one before it. No autonomous action bypasses human review.

This architecture gives you something most "AI agent" demos ignore: *auditability*. Every decision has a paper trail. Every output was approved. You can debug any failure just by reading files.

The lesson: agentic systems that actually work in production aren't magic. They're disciplined pipelines with explicit state, clear handoffs, and humans still in the loop for anything sensitive.

If you're building agents for real use cases — not just demos — design the *structure* before you write a single prompt.

What's the biggest architecture mistake you've seen in AI agent projects?

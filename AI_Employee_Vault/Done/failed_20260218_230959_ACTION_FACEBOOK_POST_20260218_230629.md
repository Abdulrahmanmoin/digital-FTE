# Proposed Facebook Post

Something hit me hard this week while building an agentic AI system.

I was debugging why my AI "employee" kept making decisions that seemed logical in isolation but totally missed the bigger picture. Hours of tracing logs, tweaking prompts, adjusting context windows — nothing worked.

Then I realized the problem wasn't the AI at all. It was me. I hadn't given it enough structured context about *why* certain decisions matter, not just *what* to decide. The moment I separated "perception" (what the agent sees) from "reasoning" (what it should think about) from "action" (what it's allowed to do), everything clicked.

That separation changed everything. Suddenly the agent started behaving like a thoughtful collaborator instead of a pattern-matcher firing in the dark.

It's a lesson I keep relearning in software: complexity isn't the enemy — *unclear boundaries* are. Whether it's microservices, component design, or AI agents, the magic almost always lives in how you define the seams between things.

Good architecture isn't about being clever. It's about making responsibilities obvious enough that anyone — human or machine — can pick up where you left off.

If you're building with AI agents right now, what's the hardest architectural decision you've had to make? I'd love to hear how others are thinking about this.

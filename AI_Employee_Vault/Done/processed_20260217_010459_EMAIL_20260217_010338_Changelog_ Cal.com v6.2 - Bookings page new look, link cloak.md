By the Cal.com Product Team • Issue #44 ( https://cal.com/blog/calcom-v6-2 )

Hello, welcome to this month’s feature update! This month, we’ve focused on a few key areas to improve your experience:

-----------------------------------------
Bookings page calendar view + history log
-----------------------------------------

( https://app.cal.com/settings/my-account/features )

Calendar view has been one of the most requested ways to browse your schedule in Cal.com. A lot of you told us the list view is fine for quick checks, but it’s not great when you’re trying to understand your week, spot gaps, or just get a real sense of what’s coming up. Calendar view fixes that. It gives you a clear picture of your days without extra clicking, so you can scan, orient yourself, and move on.
While you’re there, you’ll also notice the refreshed booking details page. It’s cleaner and easier to scan. And we’re not done yet. A better history log is coming soon, so stay tuned.
To try it, you’ll need to opt in first from your Features settings ( https://app.cal.com/settings/my-account/features ) page. If it takes a bit to get used to, that’s totally fair. You can opt out anytime from the same page and go back to the previous look. You can also manage other experimental features there too, keep them enabled automatically, or turn them off whenever you want.

--------------------------------------
Custom locations for Round Robin hosts
--------------------------------------

Round Robin just got a lot more flexible. You can now let each host use their own meeting location inside the same Round Robin event. So if one teammate runs calls on Zoom, another uses Google Meet, and someone prefers Cal Video or an in-person address, that’s totally fine. When a booking gets assigned, Cal automatically applies the right location for that host, so the invite shows the correct link or address without anyone needing to fix it after.
This is especially handy for teams that share one booking page but don’t share one setup. No more “sorry, wrong link” messages. No more manual edits. Just a smoother handoff from booking to meeting.

This feature is available for Organizations customers.

-----------------------------------------
Link cloaking is back - with URL scanners
-----------------------------------------

( https://app.cal.com/workflows )

Link cloaking is back for Teams and Organization users. So your custom workflow emails can use clean, readable links again instead of long pasted URLs. Cal.com
We know this one caused noise when it was removed. Cloaked links can be abused, but removing the feature also made many normal, legit emails look worse and feel less polished. So we’re bringing it back and fixing the real problem instead.
To help fight malicious links, we’re adding URL scanning powered by Cloudflare’s URL Scanner. The goal is simple: nicer emails by default, with stronger protection behind the scenes.

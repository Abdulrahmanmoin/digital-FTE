# Proposed LinkedIn Post

I've been building AI agents for a few months now, and the biggest lesson wasn't about models or prompts.

It was about **file systems**.

Here's what I mean:

When you build an agentic system, you're tempted to wire everything through function calls and in-memory state. Fast. Clean. Elegant.

But it breaks the moment you need a human in the loop.

The pattern that actually works: use files and folders as your primary interface between components.

Each agent writes what it perceives. A planner reads and reasons. A human approves. An executor acts.

The folder structure *is* the workflow.

This approach gives you things that pure code pipelines can't:
→ Full auditability — every decision leaves a trace
→ Human approval gates that feel natural, not bolted on
→ Restartability — kill any process, restart it, nothing is lost
→ Debuggability — you can inspect state without a debugger

It sounds boring. It's not. It's the difference between a fragile demo and a system that actually runs 24/7.

The AI isn't the hard part. The architecture around the AI is.

If you're building agents that need to run reliably in production, treat the file system like a first-class citizen. It will save you more headaches than any framework.

What's the architecture pattern you keep coming back to when building agentic systems?

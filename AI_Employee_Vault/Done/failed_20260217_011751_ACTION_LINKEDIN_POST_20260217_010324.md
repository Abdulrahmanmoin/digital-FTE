# Proposed LinkedIn Post

Most developers think "AI agents" means chatbots with extra steps.

It doesn't. And the distinction matters a lot.

A chatbot responds to prompts. An agent *acts* on the world — it reads files, calls APIs, makes decisions, and loops until a goal is reached. The interface isn't a chat window. It's a folder, a database, or a queue.

I've been building an autonomous "AI Employee" system this week and the biggest insight wasn't about LLMs — it was about architecture.

The key design decision: **files as the interface between components.**

Each sense component (Gmail, LinkedIn, Odoo) writes structured Markdown files to a `Needs_Action/` folder. A reasoning step runs Claude against those files. A human reviews the proposed action. Only then does an executor act.

No single script. No end-to-end automation without a checkpoint. Every decision is auditable because every decision is a file.

This pattern forces you to separate *perception*, *reasoning*, *approval*, and *action* into distinct components. It sounds like overhead. In practice, it's what makes the system trustworthy enough to actually run 24/7.

The lesson: the hard part of agentic systems isn't the AI — it's the architecture around the AI.

If you're building anything with agents, I'd strongly recommend starting with the folder structure before writing a single prompt.

What's the trickiest architectural decision you've faced when building autonomous systems? Would love to hear how others are solving this.

Hey there –
 
Below is a short overview of what’s new in Clerk over the past couple of weeks. We've been busy, and we're excited to share a few
updates with you!
 
Track product stickiness with the new user retention report
Track how sticky your product is with automatic user retention reporting. Clerk now includes a retention report in the Dashboard
that helps you understand how frequently users return after signing up, visualize retention trends over time, and compare
performance against benchmarks.
 



 
This makes it easy to support Web3-native user flows without custom wallet auth infrastructure. Read more →

More control with Role Sets for Organizations
Role Sets let you define which roles are available inside each organization. This gives you more control over how permissions are
structured across different customers, plans, or product tiers.
 



 
Instead of exposing every role, you can now tailor role availability per organization. Read more → [https://go.clerk.com/U4vrOeZ]
 



Smarter default organization name and logo
Clerk can now automatically suggest both a name and logo for a user’s first organization during onboarding.
 



 
Suggestions are inferred from signals like the user’s email domain or profile information, helping users get set up faster with
fewer decisions. You can enable this behavior or keep organization creation fully manual, depending on your setup. Read more →

Local verification with JWT OAuth access tokens
OAuth access tokens now default to JWT format for new applications. JWT tokens allow local verification, better compatibility with
third-party services, and simpler debugging.
 



 
If your use case requires immediate revocation, opaque tokens are still supported. Read more → [https://go.clerk.com/DqFjIsc]
 



 
Secret key access controls
Secret key management is now restricted to Admins. Members can still view non-sensitive metadata, but only Admins can create,
reveal, or delete keys. This improves security while keeping teams informed. Read more → [https://go.clerk.com/k1KqFuq]
 



 
Hide incomplete analytics periods
You can now hide incomplete time periods on the Overview analytics page. This keeps reports clean and avoids confusion when a
period has not fully completed. Read more → [https://go.clerk.com/TFLLhwd]
 



 



 
Other features, fixes, and improvements
 * Sign-in with Solana [https://go.clerk.com/xgFVYxO]

 * Member role can no longer manage secret keys within the Clerk Dashboard [https://go.clerk.com/Yz61TZe]

 



 
Founders, Food, and First Principles
Earlier this week, Colin and the team camped out at Woolly Pig near the YC offices to treat founders to lunch and talk shop. It
was a great chance to connect with current Clerk users and let early-stage builders pick Colin’s brain about the initial days of
finding product-market fit. We spent the time nerding out on everything from the state of Auth and MCP to locally built drones!
 



 
Lastly, if you’re working on something new, head over to your Clerk dashboard [https://go.clerk.com/sbbfxqI] and start building
today.
 
Thanks for reading!

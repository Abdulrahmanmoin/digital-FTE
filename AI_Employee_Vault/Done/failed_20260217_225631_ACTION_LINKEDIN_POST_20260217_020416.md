# Proposed LinkedIn Post

I built an AI agent that monitors my inbox, drafts replies, and waits for my approval before sending anything.

It's been running for two weeks. Here's what surprised me most:

The bottleneck isn't the AI — it's me.

The agent drafts a reply in seconds. I then spend 3 minutes reading the original email, reading the draft, tweaking a word, and clicking approve.

That's not automation. That's delegation with extra steps.

But here's the insight I didn't expect: **the friction is the feature.**

When everything is instant, you stop thinking. The approval step forces me to stay in the loop — to actually read what's going out under my name. The agent handles the cognitive load of drafting; I handle the judgment call of sending.

This is what agentic systems should feel like. Not "AI does everything while you watch." More like: AI handles the mechanical work, human stays accountable for the decisions.

The architecture is simple:
→ Watcher reads inbox
→ Orchestrator drafts a plan
→ File lands in Pending_Approval/
→ I move it to Approved/
→ Action executes

Files as the interface. Human in the loop. No magic, no black box.

If you're building agentic systems, don't optimize the human out of the workflow too early. The approval step isn't a bug in your automation — it's the trust layer that makes it safe to automate at all.

What's your take: how much autonomy should an AI agent have before requiring human sign-off?

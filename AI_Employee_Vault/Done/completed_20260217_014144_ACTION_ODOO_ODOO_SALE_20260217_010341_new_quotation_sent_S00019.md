# Odoo Event: new_quotation_sent — S00019

## Summary
Quotation S00019 for customer YourCompany / Joel Willis ($1,740.00) has been in "Quotation Sent" state since 2026-01-16 — over 32 days with no confirmation or response from the customer.

## Urgency: MEDIUM
The quotation is significantly overdue for follow-up (32+ days since sent). The deal is at risk of being lost due to inactivity. Action is needed this week to either advance or close the opportunity.

## Recommended Actions
- **Follow up with customer:** Have Mitchell Admin contact Joel Willis (YourCompany) to check on the status of quotation S00019
- **If customer wants to proceed:** Confirm the order in Odoo — Sales > Orders > S00019 > Confirm Order
- **If customer needs changes:** Revise the quotation, update line items/pricing, and re-send
- **If customer has declined or is unresponsive:** Cancel the quotation in Odoo to keep the pipeline accurate
- **After confirmation:** Schedule delivery if applicable and issue the invoice promptly (current invoice status: none)

## Context
- Assigned salesperson: Mitchell Admin
- No internal notes or comments on the order
- No source/origin channel recorded — unclear how the lead was generated
- Order date: 2026-01-16 | Amount: $1,740.00 | Currency: not specified (assumed USD/local)
- This is a stale quotation, not an overdue invoice — no immediate financial penalty, but pipeline hygiene and customer relationship are at risk

Hello,

I hope you're doing well.

I'm looking to get a *custom website developed* and would like to understand your services, approach, and pricing. The website would be built according to specific requirements and design preferences, which I can share in detail once we connect.

Could you please let me know:

- Your experience with custom website development
- The technologies you typically use
- An estimated price range for a custom website
- Your expected timeline for delivery

If possible, please also share a few relevant examples of your previous work.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Rahomn James Moon

Hi Abdul,

Thank you for reaching out regarding custom website development. I appreciate your interest and would be happy to discuss how I can help.

To give you the most accurate information on pricing, timeline, and the right technology stack, it would be best if you could share more details about your project. Specifically:

- The type of website you need (e.g., business site, e-commerce, portfolio, web application)
- Key features and functionality you have in mind
- Any design preferences or reference sites you like
- Your target launch date, if any

Once I have a clearer picture of your requirements, I can put together a tailored proposal with a detailed scope, timeline, and cost estimate.

I work with modern web technologies including React, Next.js, Node.js, and Python, and I select the best stack based on each project's specific needs.

Feel free to share your requirements at your convenience, or we can set up a quick call to discuss further.

Best regards

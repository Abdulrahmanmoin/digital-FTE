# Proposed Facebook Post

Something clicked for me this week that I wish someone had told me years ago.

I was building an agentic AI system — the kind that runs 24/7, monitors your email, social feeds, and business tools, then drafts responses for you to approve. Pretty cool in theory. But I kept running into the same trap: I wanted to make it "smarter" by giving it more autonomy.

Then I realized: the magic isn't in removing the human from the loop. It's in designing the loop so the human barely has to think.

Instead of autonomous execution, I built a system where the AI does all the heavy lifting — reading, reasoning, drafting — and drops a single file into a folder. I glance at it, move it to "Approved", and it executes. Five seconds of my attention instead of thirty minutes of manual work.

That's the shift. From "AI replaces you" to "AI handles the cognitive load, you make the call."

It's transformed how I think about every tool I build now. The goal isn't full automation — it's reducing friction to almost zero while keeping me in control of what actually matters.

If you're building anything with AI agents, I'd genuinely recommend designing for this kind of human-in-the-loop experience before you ever think about going fully autonomous.

What's your take — do you trust AI tools more when you stay in the loop, or do you prefer full automation?

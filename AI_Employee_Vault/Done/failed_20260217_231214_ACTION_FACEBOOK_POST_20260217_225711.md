# Proposed Facebook Post

I've been building AI agents that run 24/7 as autonomous "digital employees" — and the biggest lesson so far has nothing to do with AI.

It's about files.

When I started, I thought the hard part would be getting the AI to reason well. Turns out, the hard part is coordination. How do different components talk to each other without stepping on each other's toes? How do you enforce human approval without building a whole UI?

My answer: folders and markdown files.

Each agent writes a file when it sees something interesting. Another agent picks it up, reasons about it, and writes a plan. A human moves the plan to an "Approved" folder. Only then does anything actually happen in the real world.

It sounds almost embarrassingly simple. But it works. It's auditable — I can see exactly what the system was thinking. It's safe — nothing fires without a human checkpoint. And it's debuggable — when something goes wrong, I just read the files.

The fanciest AI in the world still needs boring infrastructure underneath it. Async queues, state files, retry logic, rate limiting. The "agentic" magic is maybe 20% of the work.

If you're building AI systems right now, I'd love to know — what's been your biggest surprise? Was it the AI part, or the plumbing around it?

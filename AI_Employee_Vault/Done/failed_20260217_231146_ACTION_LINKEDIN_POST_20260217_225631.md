# Proposed LinkedIn Post

Most developers think about AI agents wrong.

They treat them like smart autocomplete — you ask, it answers, done.

But the real power comes when you stop thinking about AI as a tool and start thinking about it as an employee.

An employee has a workflow. It receives tasks, makes a plan, asks for approval on risky decisions, executes, and reports back. It doesn't collapse everything into one giant function call.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

→ Separate perception from action (what the agent sees vs. what it does)
→ Make reasoning explicit — write plans to files before executing anything
→ Enforce human approval for sensitive operations
→ Use folders and files as the interface, not just API calls
→ Design for long-running reliability, not one-shot demos

The moment I started building agents this way, everything clicked. Debugging got easier. Auditing got easier. Handing off to humans got easier.

The folder structure IS the system. Files are the memory. Approval flows are the conscience.

This approach scales from a simple email responder to a full multi-platform digital employee handling Gmail, LinkedIn, X, and business ops — all running autonomously while keeping a human in the loop for anything that matters.

The architecture isn't glamorous. But it works.

Are you building agents as one-shot scripts, or as long-running systems with real structure? I'd love to hear what's working for you.

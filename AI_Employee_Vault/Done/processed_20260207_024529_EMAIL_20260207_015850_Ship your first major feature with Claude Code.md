Ship features with confidence 
Claude Code speeds up shipping larger features from days to minutes. Here’s 
your guide to building faster: 






Start in Plan Mode 
In Plan Mode, Claude Code explores your codebase and creates a detailed plan 
before editing any code.

Enter Plan Mode by pressing `shift+tab+tab`.

> Think through how to add OAuth authentication to our app. Show the 
architecture, files we'll need, and implementation steps. Feel free to ask me 
questions. 






Write tests first, then implement 
Claude Code can write comprehensive tests to catch edge cases early and give 
you confidence that the code works correctly.

> Write comprehensive tests for the OAuth flow - signup, login, token refresh, 
and error cases. Make sure they fail for now. Then, implement the OAuth system 
to make these tests pass. 






Level up to auto-accept mode 
Once Claude Code is on the right track, hit `shift+tab` to let Claude Code 
autonomously edit files in your directory.

Pro tip: You can send messages anytime while Claude works and Claude adjusts 
course immediately.
